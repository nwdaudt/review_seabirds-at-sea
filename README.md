# Counting seabirds at-sea from vessels: a review (1971--2020)

This repository hosts the code and data from a literature review concerning vessel-based surveys focused on seabirds from 1971 to 2020, and synthesise the methods and protocols (or adaptations of) used by researchers to count seabirds at-sea, their research questions and the analyses they employed. I also summarise spatial-temporal patterns of `effort' (i.e. using number of publications as a proxy).

In total, I gathered 810 peer-reviewed papers (not yet uploaded here), but this list might still grow as I am doing some digging to find some files. 

For the purpose of this synthesis, I randomly selected 100 papers to extract and display the data. This is a work in progress, as I aim to extract data from all papers in the near future.

More detail to this repository will be added in the future, but if you have any questions, please email me at <nicholaswdaudt@gmail.com>.
